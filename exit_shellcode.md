# Shellcode for exit() Syscall

Im reading at the time a great book [The Shellcoder's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Holes](https://www.amazon.com/Shellcoders-Handbook-Discovering-Exploiting-Security/dp/047008023X). I want to take my binary exploitation skills a step farther. Im writing this tutorial because i want to understand better what im reading/doing like a guy said "you think you understand something until you try to teach it" & because i want to use this as my personal "cheat sheet" if you get me. Let's begin!
